# pynlp-conda-env

This is a standardized default package configuration for Natural Language Processing projects.\
I do not claim any rights to the below mentioned packages and do not provide a direct reupload.\
This repository only provides the necessary config files to recreate the detailed setup.\
Repostitory will be updated regularly.

## Requirements
Please install the Anaconda Data Science Toolkit, available here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual \
(Technically you don't need it, however it is a good practice and quasi-standard to use it.)

## Installation

To create a conda env from the environment.yml file:\
`conda env create (-n <env_name>) -f environment.yml`

To create a conda env from the requirements.txt file:\
`conda create -n <env_name> -f requirements.txt`

Verify installation with:\
`conda env list`

Dependencies and some useful smaller packages are included in the environment.\

## Additional steps
Finally, here are some command to install some models / corpora that you will most definitely need when working with text data.

  Select and download the preferred packages for your use case.

## FAQ & Troubleshooting

**How do I get rid of the gensim UserWarning about a certain package being unavailable?**
- Try suppressing these warnings with the python warning module or install the unavailable module.
